# cpp-stuff

A collection of implementations of various Data Structures & Algorithms in cpp, using some C++17 features.

**WARNING** : I wrote these while trying to learn some of the basics of modern C++, having used only Python for a long time before this. Code in various parts of the programs may be poorly written. I uploaded it here, like many other old repos on this github account, just as an archive of my learning curve. (However, these are the most complex C++ programs I've written as of now & i feel proud of managing it :sweat_smile:).
I would likely still use the STL or other established libraries instead, in a practial scenario.
